        The Persian cat, also known as the Persian longhair, is a long-haired breed of cat characterized by a round face and short muzzle. The first documented ancestors of Persian cats might have been imported into Italy from Khorasan as early as around 1620, however this has not been proven. Instead there is stronger evidence for a longhaired cat breed being exported from Afghanistan and Iran from the 19th century onwards.Widely recognized by cat fancy since the late 19th century, Persian cats were first adopted by the British, and later by American breeders after World War II. Some cat fancier organizations' breed standards subsume the Himalayan and Exotic Shorthair as variants of this breed, while others generally treat them as separate breeds.The selective breeding carried out by breeders has allowed the development of a wide variety of coat colors, but has also led to the creation of increasingly flat-faced Persian cats. Favored by fanciers, this head structure can bring with it a number of health problems. As is the case with the Siamese breed, there have been efforts by some breeders to preserve the older type of cat, the traditional breed, having a more pronounced muzzle, which is more popular with the general public. Hereditary polycystic kidney disease is prevalent in the breed, affecting almost half of the population in some countries.In 2021, Persian cats were ranked as the fourth-most popular cat breed in the world according to the Cat Fanciers' Association, an American non-profit cat registry.Traditional Persian is one of several names for a group of cats that are considered to be essentially the original breed of Persian cat, before the variety was selectively bred to have extreme features. Other everyday usage names are: Doll Face Persian, Classic Persian, Old Fashioned Persian, Long-nosed Persian, Old-style Longhair, Traditional Longhair and Original Longhair.The physical appearance of this domestic cat breed barely changed when compared to photos dating back to the late 1800s. However, since some breeders in the United States and other parts of the world introduced the brachycephalic mutation into the breed, the short nose and clear break became shorter and higher. This resulted in the modification of the original Persian breed standard so that modern show quality Persians must have peke-faces. This resulted in the breed disappearing from cat shows.However, this older form of Persian cat is immortalized in some of the most iconic and successful English language films .Has been featured in 8 movies of the James Bond 007 Franchisee beginning with "From Russia with Love" in 1963 to other James Bond films like 'You Only Live Twice. Has also been featured in the Kungfu cult classic Enter the Dragon.The Persian is a cat from Persia (now Iran). It is one of the oldest breeds of domesticated cats. It has a long and rich history that can be traced back to ancient Persia. The first documented reference to the Persian cat was in a book written by an Islamic scholar named Ibn Al-Nafis in 1258 AD.He described them as a longhaired cat that the royal family kept in Persia.Persian cat are called Longhair or Persian Longhair in Britain. It was made by English breeders and the American ones after the Second World War.Because of very careful breeding, it has gotten a really flat face and many different colors. While most cat fanciers love the flat faced Persian, this brings along many illnesses. The public likes the traditional faced Persian more than the flat faced one.They can get polycystic kidney disease easily.The gentle and easy-going nature of the Persian makes it very easy to live in apartments with this cat. While it is the top cat in the United States, its popularity has decreased in France and the United Kingdom.Persian cats are not an ordinary cat, they can barely live outside in the wild.</p>

        <p>   The first Persian cat was presented at the first organized cat show, in 1871 in the Crystal Palace in London, England, organized by Harrison Weir. As specimens closer to the later established Persian conformation became the more popular types, attempts were made to differentiate it from the Angora.The first breed standard (then called a points of excellence list) was issued in 1889 by cat show promoter Weir. Weir stated that the Persian differed from the Angora in the tail being longer, hair more full and coarse at the end, and head larger, with less pointed ears.Not all cat fanciers agreed with the distinction of the two types, and in the 1903 work, The Book of the Cat, Francis Simpson states that "the distinctions, apparently with hardly any difference, between Angoras and Persians are of so fine a nature that I must be pardoned if I ignore the class of cat commonly called Angora".
        Dorothy Bevill Champion lays out the difference between the two types in the 1909 Everybody's Cat Book.Our pedigree imported long-hairs of to-day are undoubtedly a cross of the Angora and Persian; the latter possesses a rounder head than the former, also the coat is of quite a different quality.Bell goes on to detail the differences. Persian coats consist of a woolly under coat and a long, hairy outer coat. The coat loses all the thick underwool in the summer, and only the long hair remains. Hair on the shoulders and upper part of the hind legs is somewhat shorter. Conversely, the Angora has a very different coat which consists of long, soft hair, hanging in locks, "inclining to a slight curl or wave on the under parts of the body." The Angora's hair is much longer on the shoulders and hind legs than the Persian, which Bell considered a great improvement. However, Bell says the Angora "fails to the Persian in head," Angoras having a more wedge-shaped head and Persians having a rounder head.Bell notes that Angoras and Persians have been crossbred, resulting in a decided improvement to each breed, but claimed the long-haired cat of 1909 had significantly more Persian influence than Angora.Champion lamented the lack of distinction among various long-haired types by English fanciers, who in 1887, decided to group them under the umbrella term "Long-haired Cats".The Persian cat, also known as the Persian longhair, is a long-haired breed of cat characterized by a round face and short muzzle. The first documented ancestors of Persian cats might have been imported into Italy from Khorasan as early as around 1620, however this has not been proven.They take longer to reach their full size and maturity, typically stopping growth at two years old, when they reach an average maximum weight of 7-12 pounds, height of 8-10 inches, and length of 14.5-17.5 inches. Keep in mind that larger cat breeds also take longer to mature.Persian Kittens normally weigh in between 3.0 and 3.5 oz. Smaller Persian kittens have lower chances at survival. And I have found larger Persian kittens tend to also have difficult surviving. I believe it is related to the moms have more difficult birthing a larger kitten with a larger head, and that cuts off oxygen level to the brain, making them lose some of their natural sucking instincts. Persian Eyes open between 10-14 days. If the eyes have not opened yet or look bulged, make sure fluid is not being retained locked under the lid sealed shut. If it is, simply carefully open the eye with a warm water wash and drain fluid puss out, and then add some triple antibacterial ointment.

        <p>   In 2008, the Persian was the most popular breed of pedigree cats in the United States.In the UK, registration numbers have dwindled since the early 1990s and the Persian lost its top spot to the British Shorthair in 2001. As of 2012, it was the 6th most popular breed, behind the British Shorthair, Ragdoll, Siamese, Maine Coon and Burmese.In France, the Persian is the only breed whose registration declined between 2003 and 2007, dropping by more than a quarter.
        The most color popular varieties, according to CFA registration data, are seal point, blue point, flame point and tortie point Himalayan, followed by black-white, shaded silvers and calico.Persian cats are calm and gentle creatures who don't do well with loud noises and constant disruption. They are incredibly affectionate toward their pet parents, but their calm and reserved nature make them ideal for quieter homes without young kids.The Persian cat is a popular breed worldwide. It becomes more alluring and beautiful due to its attractiveness, flowing coat, charming face, and serene nature. In India, it is one of the most well-liked cat breeds. They demand routine grooming and are appropriate for tiny apartments.The Persian cat breed is renowned for having long, soft fur as well as laid-back personalities that make them a pleasure to be around. Before adopting a Persian kitty, however, prospective owners should be aware that they require more care than their feline brethren.The exact origins of the Persian cat are obscure. But it came to the attention of Europeans when diplomats stationed in the Middle East brought the first long-haired cats back to England and other European countries in the mid-1800s. Two of the best-known cats were Persians from Iran (seat of the ancient Persian Empire) and Angoras named for Ankara in Turkey. These long-haired beauties, both Persian and Angora cats, were an immediate hit with Westerners. The Persian cat was immediately prized for its exotic looks and named for its presumed homelands.Purebred cats closely followed the creation of the first kennel clubs in Europe in the mid-19th century. The world's first cat show was held in London's Crystal Palace in 1871, and the first purebred Persians arrived in the United States around 1875. The rise of cat breeding houses on both sides of the Atlantic at the turn of the 20th century was largely driven by the popularity of the Persian cat, considered one of the earliest pedigreed cats.Persians are popular for more than their good looks. They're also exceptionally friendly ... for a cat.
        "Most cats are affectionate on their own terms," says Susan MacArthur, who's been breeding Persians at Pelaqita Persians for 20 years. "We call Persians 'dog cats,' because they really like people. They also do things that normal cats don't do."
        Persians will run to the door to greet visitors and even come when they're called by name, a doggy trick that most cats feel is beneath them. Persians are also known to be "talkative," chatting with their owners in a sing-songy meow.
        But don't get the idea that Persians are overly active animals.
        "They are the laziest breed in the world," says MacArthur. "They literally sleep 20 hours a day. Even the kittens don't play very much."
        But that's just fine with Persian fans. Their laid-back, lap-napping style means that Persians are less likely to hop up on counters and rummage through cabinets searching for food.        </P>

         <P>     The Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA), of the United States, groups the breed into four coat-pattern divisions, but differently: solid, silver and golden (including chinchilla and shaded variants, and blued subvariants), shaded and smoke (with several variations of each, and a third sub-categorization called shell), tabby (only classic, mackerel, and patched [spotted], in various colors), parti-color (in four classes, tortoiseshell, blue-cream, chocolate tortie, and lilac-cream, mixed with other colors), calico and bi-color (in around 40 variations, broadly classified as calico, dilute calico, and bi-color), and Himalayan (white-to-fawn body with point coloration on the head, tail and limbs, in various tints). CFA base colors are white, black, blue, red, cream, chocolate, and lilac. There are around 140 named CFA coat patterns for which the Himalayan qualifies, and 20 for the Himalayan sub-breed.[43] These coat patterns encompass virtually all of those recognized by CFA for cats generally. Any Persian permissible in TICA's more detailed system would probably be accepted in CFA's, simply with a more general name, though the organizations do not mix breed registries.The International Cat Association (TICA) groups the breed into three coat-pattern divisions for judging at cat shows: traditional (with stable, rich colors), sepia ("paler and warmer than the traditional equivalents", and darkening a bit with age), and mink (much lighter than sepia, and developing noticeably with age on the face and extremities). If classified as the Himalayan sub-breed, full point coloration is required, the fourth TICA color division, with a "pale and creamy colored" body even lighter than mink, with intense coloration on the face an extremities. The four TICA categories are essentially a graduated scale of color distribution from evenly colored to mostly colored only at the points. Within each, the coloration may be further classified as solid, tortoiseshell (or "tortie"), tabby, silver or smoke, solid-and-white, tortoiseshell-and-white, tabby-and-white, or silver/smoke-and-white, with various specific colors and modifiers (e.g. chocolate tortoiseshell point, or fawn shaded mink marbled tabby-torbie). TICA-recognized tabby patterns include classic, mackerel, marbled, spotted, and ticked (in two genetic forms), while other patterns include shaded, chinchilla, and two tabbie-tortie variations, golden, and grizzled. Basic colors include white, black, brown, ruddy, bronze, "blue" (grey), chocolate, cinnamon, lilac, fawn, red, cream, with a silver or shaded variant of most. Not counting bi-color (piebald) or parti-color coats, nor combinations that are genetically impossible, there are nearly 1,000 named coat pattern variations in the TICA system for which the Persian/Himalayan qualifies. The Exotic Shorthair sub-breed qualifies for every cat coat variation that TICA recognizes.Eye colors range widely, and may include blue, copper, odd-eyed blue and copper, green, blue-green, and hazel. Various TICA and CFA coat categorizations come with specific eye-color requirements.These range from silver and gold to white, smoky and solid-colored. Their eye color corresponds to their coat color. For example, white Persians tend to have deep blue or copper eyes, whereas silver or golden Persians have green eyes and solid-colored cats have copper eyes.Blue, black, and white ones are common, while chocolate and lilac variants are much rarer.CFA base colors are white, black, blue, red, cream, chocolate, and lilac. There are around 140 named CFA coat patterns for which the Himalayan qualifies, and 20 for the Himalayan sub-breed. These coat patterns encompass virtually all of those recognized by CFA for cats generally.
